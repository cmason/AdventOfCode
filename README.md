# Advent of Code Solutions
This repository contains my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.
Each year is broken out into its own folder.

You can run `bin/scaffold` to create the source and test files, download the
puzzle description, and puzzle input.

```bash
✗ scaffold
Usage: .git/safe/../../bin/scaffold [year] <day>
  year: optional, defaults to current year (2025)
  day:  required, 1-25
```

The `scaffold` script uses [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) to download the
puzzle description and input.
